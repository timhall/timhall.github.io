Streams have been a fundamental part of JS, especially Node.js, fo a long time.
I worked extensively with them building plugins for Gulp what seems like forever ago (checks commits: 7 years ago).
Streams have had a bit of a renaissance of late with the introduction of the [standard Streams specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).
